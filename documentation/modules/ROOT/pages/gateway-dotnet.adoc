= Create Gateway Service with .Net
:navtitle: Create Gateway Service with .Net

_15 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about .NET and how you can 
build microservices using ASP.NET principles. During this lab you will 
create a scalable API Gateway that aggregates Catalog and Inventory APIs.

image::240px-NET_Core_Logo.png[.NET, 240]

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/introduction/[.NET (Core)^] is a 
is a free, open-source development platform for building many kinds of apps, from web, serverless, mobile, desktop and console apps.
With .NET your code and project files look and feel the same no matter which type of app you're building and you have access to the 
same runtime, API and language capabilities with each app.
You can create .NET apps for many operating systems, including Windows, Linux and MacOS on a variety of hardware. .NET lets 
you use platform-specific capabilities, such as operating system APIs. Examples are Windows Forms and WPF on Windows .NET is open 
source, https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT[using MIT and Apache 2 licenses^] .NET is a project of the https://dotnetfoundation.org/[.NET Foundation.^]

pass:[.NET] supports a number of programming faces and development environments, but today we will be looking at C# inside CodeReady Workspaces.

We will also be using the standard web server pattern provided by ASP .NET libraries for creating non-blocking web services.

== .NET Gateway Project 

The **gateway-dotnet** project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the project laid out in different subdirectories according to ASP .NET best practices:

image::dotnet-gateway-project.png[Gateway Project,340]

This is a minimal ASP .NET project with support for asynchronous REST services. 

`*Examine 'Startup.cs' class*` in the **/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet/** directory.

See how the basic web server is started with minimal services, health checks and a basic REST controller is deployed.

[source,dotnet]
----
// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddCors();

    services.AddControllers().AddJsonOptions(options=> 
    {  
            options.JsonSerializerOptions.IgnoreNullValues = true;
    });

    services.AddHealthChecks();
    services.AddControllersWithViews();
}

// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    
    ProductsController.Config();

    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }

    app.UseCors(builder => builder
            .AllowAnyOrigin ()
            .AllowAnyHeader ()
            .AllowAnyMethod ());

    app.UseHealthChecks("/health");

    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseDefaultFiles();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        endpoints.MapControllers();
        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
            name: "default",
            pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    });

}

----

`*Examine 'ProductsController.cs' class*` in the **/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet/Controllers** directory.

[source,dotnet]
----
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")] // <1>
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Products> Get()
    {            
        private static HttpClient catalogHttpClient = new HttpClient(); // <4>
        private static HttpClient inventoryHttpClient = new HttpClient(); 

        try
        {
            // get the product list
            IEnumerable<Products> productsList = GetCatalog(); // <2>

            // update each item with their inventory value
            foreach(Products p in productsList) // <3>
            {
                Inventory inv = GetInventory(p.ItemId);
                if (inv != null)
                    p.Availability = new Availability(inv);
            }    

            return productsList;
        }
        catch(Exception e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Using Catalog service: " + catalogApiHost + " and Inventory service: " + inventoryApiHost);
            Console.WriteLine("Failure to get service data: " + e.Message);
            // on failures return error
            throw e;
        }
    }

    private IEnumerable<Products> GetCatalog()
    { 
        var data = catalogHttpClient.GetStringAsync("/api/catalog").Result; 
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<IEnumerable<Products>>(data);
    }
    
    private Inventory GetInventory(string itemId)
    {
        var data = inventoryHttpClient.GetStringAsync("/api/inventory/" + itemId).Result;
        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Inventory>(data);
    }

}
----
<1> Not unlike the Quarkus and Spring boot apps previously built, the ProductsController has a single defined REST entrypoint for GET */api/products*
<2> In this case the Get() service first requests a list of products from the Catalog microservice
<3> It then steps through each in turn to discover the amount of product in stock. It does this by calling the Inventory service for each product.
<4> By using an HttpClient class for each service, .NET will efficiently manage the connection handling.

The location or binding to the existing Catalog and Inventory REST services is injected at runtime via environment variables. 

== Deploy on OpenShift

Itâ€™s time to build and deploy your service on OpenShift. 

As you did previously for the Inventory and Catalog services in the earlier chapters, you need to `*create a new Component and URL and then Push it in to the OpenShift cluster*`
by using the following parameters:

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' and execute the 'Gateway' tasks in the correct order.*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 500]
--

CLI::
+
--
`*Execute the following commands in the '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
cd /projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet
odo component create --s2i
----

`*Execute the proper commands with the following parameters:*`

NOTE: Unlike Catalog and Inventory service, you are going to push the **'gateway-dotnet/'** folder as an input to OpenShift. 
OpenShift will build the .NET .dll file from the project file and source code for you.

.OpenShift New Component
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Question 
|Answer

|Which component type do you wish to create
|**dotnet**

|Which version of 'dotnet' component type do you wish to create 
|**3.1-ubi8**

|Which input type do you wish to use for the component
|**local**

|Location of context component, relative to '/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet' (.)
|_Empty ('/projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet' by default)_

|What do you wish to name the new component (dotnet-gateway--xxx)
|**gateway**

|Which application do you want the component to be associated with (app)
| **coolstore**

|Which project go you want the component to be created in (my-project{USER_ID})
|_Empty ('my-project{USER_ID}' by default)_

|Do you wish to set advanced options
|_Empty ('No' by default)_

|===

.OpenShift New URL
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|URL name
|gateway

|port to expose
|8080

|===

IMPORTANT: Do not forget to **push** your new component

NOTE: To open a '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Open Terminal in specific container' ->  'workshop-tools'*`
--
====

The Gateway Component needs to be `*connected to the Inventory and Catalog components*` in order to interact.
OpenShift provides linking mechanisms to publish communication bindings from a program to its clients by injecting the environment variables **COMPONENT_xxx_HOST** and **COMPONENT_xxx_PORT**.

We are using a simple binding here between services, but in advanced labs you may learn about using service discovery or Service Mesh to make this binding dynamic.

In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'],

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'Catalog - Link to Gateway'*`

Then, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'Inventory - Link to Gateway'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 500]
--

CLI::
+
--
`*Execute the following commands in the '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
cd /projects/workshop/labs/gateway-dotnet
odo link catalog --port 8080 --component gateway 
odo link inventory --port 8080 --component gateway
----

NOTE: To open a '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Open Terminal in specific container' ->  'workshop-tools'*`
--
====

The configuration information of the Inventory and Catalog component is added to the Gateway component 
and the Gateway component restarts.

Once this completes, your application should be up and running. OpenShift runs the different components of 
the application in one or more pods which are the unit of runtime deployment and consists of the running 
containers for the project. 


== Test your Service

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Gateway Service*`

image::openshift-gateway-topology.png[OpenShift - Gateway Topology, 700]

Your browser will be redirect on **your Gateway Service running on OpenShift**.

image::gateway-service.png[Gateway Service,500]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
[ {
  "itemId" : "329299",
  "name" : "Red Fedora",
  "desc" : "Official Red Hat Fedora",
  "price" : 34.99,
  "availability" : {
    "quantity" : 35
  }
},
...
]
----

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
