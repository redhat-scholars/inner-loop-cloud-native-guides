= Get your Developer Workspace
:navtitle: Get your Developer Workspace

_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about getting your Red hat Developer Sandbox with a Kubernetes-native development platform 
and getting familiar with the OpenShift CLI, OpenShift Web Console and Dev Spaces.


[#get_your_developer_sandbox]
== Getting your Developer Sandbox for OpenShift

The Red Hat Developer Sandbox is a great way to 
access Red Hat’s products and technologies without setup or configuration, and start developing quicker than ever 
before with our new sandbox environments for Red Hat OpenShift and Dev Spaces IDE. Try your hand at the technologies 
with our library of activities as well.

The https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox[Developer Sandbox for OpenShift^] is a Kubernetes-native environment for developing 
software for OpenShift. You need to follow the *Get Started* process on the Sandbox web site first, before attempting any of the workshop steps below.

After verifying your email or mobile number you should you get access to your sandbox and be given a link to a login page to access the OpenShift Web Console, which looks like this:-

Then `*login* with DevSandbox`

[#login_to_openshift]
== Using the OpenShift Developer Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser.

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with. 

`*Select the 'Developer View' then your "-dev" project*` to be taken to the project overview page
which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have
running as part of your project. There's maybe nothing much there now, but that's about to
change.

[#what_is_codeready_workspaces]
== What is Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces?

.Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces
****
[window=_blank, align="center"]
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open-source project, the core goals of https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  are to:

* **Accelerate project and developer onboarding:** As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* **Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:** As https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  provides:

* **Workspaces:** Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* **Browser-based IDEs:** Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tooling, debuggers, terminal, source control (SCM) integration, and much more.
* **Extensible platform:** Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Multi-user capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD.

[#get_your_developer_workspace]
== Getting your Developer Workspace

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  will provide you an out-of-the-box 
*Developer Workspace* with all the tools and the dependencies we need to do the job.

[NOTE]
.Devfile
====
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] uses https://docs.devfile.io/devfile/index.html[Devfiles^] to automate the provisioning of a specific workspace by defining:

* projects to clone
* browser IDE to use
* preconfigured commands
* tools that you need
* application runtime definition

Providing a https://github.com/RedHat-EMEA-SSA-Team/end-to-end-developer-workshop/blob/rhds/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml^] file inside a Git source repository signals to https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] to configure the project and runtime according 
to this file.
====

*OpenShift Dev Spaces* is integrated into the Developer Sandbox and is available from the OpenShift Web Console using the *apps* button in the header bar.

Then `*Click 'Log in with OpenShift'*`

image::login-with-openshift.png[OpenShift - Login, 500]

Then `*login* with DevSandbox`

image::sandbox-login.png[Developer Sandbox, 400]

When Dev Spaces starts, enter the following URL into the *Git Repo URL* field to load the devfile and click `*Create & Open*`

Now there are a couple of steps before we can get started. Firstly you need to `*Trust*` the Git source you need to import for this workshop

image::vscode-trust.png[Che - Workspace, 500]

Then you need to accept or select the Visual Studio Code UI Settings. You can just click `*Mark Done*` to skip these.

image::vscode-settings.png[Che - Workspace, 500]

Once completed, you will have a fully functional Browser-based IDE within the source code already imported.

Now you are ready to get started with the labs!

[#trouble_shooting_tips]
== Sandbox Workshop Trouble Shooting Tips

We hope you have a good workshop, but here are a few tips and tricks that may make it run better.

=== What browser should I be using for this workshop?

The whole workshop runs in your browser environment which allows us to support a variety of developer platforms from Windows, Mac and Linux.
We find the best browser for this workshop is Firefox, Chrome or Edge browser.

=== Workshop stops or freezes

Everything here is browser based so might have the odd glitch. The easiest resoltuion to a number of problems is just to refresh the browser, 
or worse case restart the browser. All you work is stored centrally on our servers so you should juts be able to re-attach 
to your workspace and continue.

=== Having problems seeing OpenShift Dev Spaces

Dev Spaces use secure web sockets for its UI. If you are having problems try this test web site https://websocketstest.com. 
All results should be green to proceed. If this test fails please check that you a direct access to the internet, i.e disable any VPNs
web proxies etc. If you are using a corporate device you may need to switch to a personal computer.

=== I've been timed out or need to restart the workspace

The workshop will take a few hours to complete all the way through, if you use the system continuosly throughout 
that period you will not see this issue.

*Timed-out and wont reconnect*
Workspaces idle after about 20 to minutes of non-use. Sometimes the workspace can be started with the in browser buttons, but if not
close your Dev Spaces browser session and use the instruction on this page to *Get Your Developer Workspace*. Then *Open* your existing 
workspace rather than Creating a new one.

*Re-login to the Red Hat* Your authentication token will need to refresh for security so expect to have to login again. 
You will need you Sandbox credentials daily but they should be cached.

*Re-login from Dev Spaces* Dev Spaces can perform local tasks like builds, but usually needs to connect to your OpenShift project
to deploy. If your deployment tasks fail chances are you need to re-login to Dev Spaces. Shutdown your Dev Spaces browser session 
and use the instruction on this page to *Get Your Developer Workspace*

=== My OpenShift pods have all gone to idle

If the Developer Sandbox is left for a long period (like overnight) your OpenShift project will idle down all its running pods. On the 
Topology display they will show up with white rings. Normally these rings would be dark blue if the pod is active. You need to select each 
*Deployment* or *DeploymentConfig* that you have created in turn by clicking on the circle, then on the pop-out, select the blue (D) or (DC) text. 
Then using the circle marked as *Scaled to 0* increase the Pod count up to 1. The ring should turn blue after about 30 seconds.

=== How do I cleanup after running this workshop? ===

There is a terminal task included in the workshop to delete all the elements of the Inner Loop workshop.

`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'OpenShift - Cleanup'*`
